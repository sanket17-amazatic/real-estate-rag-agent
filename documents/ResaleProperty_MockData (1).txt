WHY THIS VILLA IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY
Hillcrest Heritage Villa brings together several elements that seldom coincide in a single listing: a substantial independent villa on a 4,500 sq.ft plot, a peaceful hilltop setting, established gated community infrastructure, and a track record of timely upgrades and maintenance. Unlike many newer compact villa formats, this home offers generous room sizes, defined outdoor spaces, and the feel of a mature, lived-in yet meticulously cared-for residence. Its location in Bavdhan Upper Hills ensures access to greenery and open views while still providing practical connectivity to key work hubs, schools, hospitals, and shopping destinations across western Pune. For buyers seeking a long-term primary residence or an aspirational upgrade from an apartment to an independent home within city limits, this property stands out as a rare and highly desirable option. A physical visit is likely to highlight not just the specifications but also the intangible sense of calm, privacy, and space that this villa offers.

The master bedroom includes a walk-in wardrobe area, giving ample space for organized storage without crowding the main sleeping area. All bedrooms feature laminated wooden flooring that lends a warm, homely feel and contrasts elegantly with the lighter finishes elsewhere in the house. Each bedroom has access to attached balconies or sit-out spaces oriented towards the hills or internal greenery, which allows residents to enjoy morning light and fresh air.

Bathrooms & Sanitary Fittings
All bathrooms in the villa have been refurbished with premium fittings from reputed brands like Jaguar and Kohler, which contribute to both durability and a contemporary look.
