Project ID: PRJ-NEW-2025-002 | Project Type: Residential Apartment | Launch Type: New Launch | Project Status: Under Construction | Possession Date: June 2028 | RERA Registration No: RERA-MH-2025-112233.

LOCATION & CONNECTIVITY
Aurora Crest Residences is situated at Plot No. 12, Celestial Lane, off Nagar Road in Viman Nagar, Pune, Maharashtra, under pincode 411014. The project lies in close proximity to major commercial hubs, IT parks, and retail destinations, making it an attractive choice for working professionals and families who want everything within a short radius. The site is a few minutes’ drive from the Pune Airport and has direct access to arterial routes connecting to Kalyani Nagar, Yerawada, Koregaon Park, Kharadi, and the Pune city core. The neighborhood has well-developed internal roads, established street lighting, and regular public transport options including buses, autos, and app-based cabs.
Aurora Crest Residences is a thoughtfully designed mid-rise residential community in Viman Nagar, Pune, featuring three elegant towers each rising 18 floors high, thoughtfully laid out around a beautifully landscaped central podium garden. The project is planned to balance density and green/open spaces, with each tower hosting eight well-proportioned apartments per floor, totaling 432 residences, all built with durable RCC frame construction designed to meet the latest seismic safety standards.

The residential units come in three distinct configurations with layouts optimized for comfort and functionality. The 2 BHK Urban Comfort residences, sized at 720 sq.ft carpet and 880 sq.ft built-up areas, offer a single balcony facing the soothing podium garden, creating a private retreat for young couples or small families. The spacious living–dining room opens onto the balcony, while the kitchen is designed for efficient modular cabinetry and cross-ventilation to enhance natural airflow throughout the day.

The 2.5 BHK Flexi Smart residences expand on this by adding a versatile smaller room which can function as a study or children’s room, complemented by two balconies and a 860 sq.ft carpet area (1,040 sq.ft built-up). Its north-facing orientation offers cityscape views, adding to the sense of space and light. This layout targets families seeking a flexible home without the full size of a 3 BHK.

For larger households, the 3 BHK Signature residences provide a generous 1,120 sq.ft carpet (1,350 sq.ft built-up) space, with two balconies facing west to capture the sunset and city lights, plus three bathrooms serving the family and guests. Two covered parking slots add convenience for this premium offering.

Aurora Crest towers are equipped with three high-speed elevators per tower, including one that is stretcher-capable, ensuring residents enjoy quick vertical transport even during peak hours. The project comes with 24×7 power backup for common areas and crucial apartment points, while water supply relies on a dual system combining municipal input and borewell sources, supported by appropriately sized overhead and underground storage tanks. Safety is paramount with fire-fighting shafts, sprinklers, alarms, and clearly marked exits incorporated into the building design.

Residents will find a vibrant community hub in the central landscaped podium featuring a well-appointed clubhouse with a residents’ lounge and reading corner, a temperature-controlled gym with cardio and strength zones, an outdoor swimming pool complete with a dedicated kids’ splash pool, and a serene yoga and meditation pavilion overlooking the gardens. Social and recreational indoor spaces include a games room for table tennis and board games, a multipurpose hall for workshops and small events, and a children’s play area equipped for all age groups. The jogging and walking track wraps around the podium perimeter and is complemented by seating courts, pergolas, and shaded sit-out spaces integrated into the landscape design. For security and peace of mind, CCTV surveillance covers all entry and exit points as well as communal areas, linked to a central security desk with intercom facilities. Early adopters of electric vehicles will appreciate dedicated EV charging stations in the parking areas, and a small business lounge or work pod zone within the clubhouse supports residents needing occasional workspace.

Indicative pricing for Aurora Crest Residences currently starts at ₹89,50,000 for 2 BHK Urban Comfort units, ₹1,05,00,000 for 2.5 BHK Flexi Smart configurations, and ₹1,32,00,000 for spacious 3 BHK Signature apartments.
